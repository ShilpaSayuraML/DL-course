Reinforcement learning 
RL involves three key concepts: 
the agent
some states
set of  actions per state.

When the agent executes an action in a specified state, it gets a reward or penalty.
Imagine Super Mario. 
Mario us the agent standing next to a cliff edge, and coin hangs above.
Marios position in the game level is the state.
If Mario moves one step to the right (an action) will take him over the edge. Now the agent get a penalty which is a low numerical score. 
If Mario jump and get the coin, he get a reward which is a plus score. 
Reinforcement learning and a simulator (the game), help you learn how to play the game to maximize the reward.
